# morgoth
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grburgess/morgoth/master/logo.png)

morgoth is the master of the balrogs. So, this is basically the pipeline for the automatic GBM localizations, sending forth balrogs to defend the lands of... ok. 

To view the pipeline in action, visit the [pipeline page](https://pipeline.grb.mpe.mpg.de) and to see the output, checkout our [GRB localizations page](https://grb.mpe.mpg.de)

This pipeline relies on [luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to synchronize and distribute jobs. The project is a joint effort between myself and our students at MPE:

* [Felix Kunzweiler](https://github.com/fkunzweiler) @fkunzweiler (website design and backend intergration)
* [Björn Biltzinger](https://github.com/BjoernBiltzinger) @BjoernBiltzinger (backend fitting pipeline)
